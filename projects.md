- Analyzed NBA player interactions (passes) to model team chemistry and playstyle across seasons.
- Created dynamic networks representing players as nodes and passes as edges, measuring team performance, playmaking roles, and chemistry using centrality and assortativity metrics.
- Explored network evolution across different NBA eras and its impact on team performance.

- Built a weather forecasting model using historical data to predict future weather conditions.
- Implemented machine learning techniques, including regression models, to forecast temperature, humidity, and other variables.
- Evaluated model accuracy and adjusted for optimal performance.
- Designed a user interface to display forecasts and visualizations.

- Developed a regression model to predict the total length of 2022 League of Legends matches using early-game data (gold difference, comeback status).
- Improved model performance from linear regression (R²: 0.185) to Random Forest Regressor (R²: 0.741) by incorporating additional features and hyperparameter tuning.
- Conducted a fairness analysis comparing World Championship matches to other leagues, confirming model fairness with a permutation test (p-value: 0.4).

- Analyzed 2022 League of Legends match data to assess if World Championship (WCS) games are more competitive than regular season games.
- Investigated the correlation between gold difference at 15 minutes and match outcomes, finding that WCS games had similar gold differences to other competitive leagues.
- Cleaned and processed data from multiple leagues and visualized key patterns in match dynamics using EDA techniques.
- Performed hypothesis testing to compare gold differences in WCS matches vs. other leagues, concluding that WCS games are not statistically more competitive in terms of early-game gold difference.
