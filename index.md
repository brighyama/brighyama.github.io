### Hi!

I'm a first-year Computer Science graduate student at UC San Diego. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with my B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science.

My primary interest lies in machine learning theory, where I explore the mathematical foundations that drive intelligent systems. Recently, I have been reading about Interpretable AI.

In my free time, I enjoy thinking about and playing competitive games, like Valorant and Chess. I also enjoy playing basketball and watching the NBA.
