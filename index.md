I'm a first-year Computer Science graduate student at UC San Diego. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with my B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science.

My primary interest lies in machine learning theory, where I explore the mathematical foundations that drive intelligent systems. Recently, I have been reading about Interpretable AI.
