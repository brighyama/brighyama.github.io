<summary>What is CSE 21?</summary>
CSE 21: Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems covers the mathematical concepts essential for modeling and analyzing algorithms and computer systems. Key topics include counting techniques (such as inclusion-exclusion, recursive counting, and permutations/combinations), data representations, and the analysis of algorithms (including order notation, time complexities, and loop invariants). The course explores recurrence relations, graphs and trees (covering data structure representations, basic graph algorithms, and special graph classes). It is also an introduction to basic probability and its applications in algorithm design and analysis.
